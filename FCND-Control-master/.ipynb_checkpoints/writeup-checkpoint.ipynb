    "In this project, you get to implement and tune a [cascade PID controller](https://controlstation.com/cascade-control-cascade-control-configured/) for drone trajectory tracking. The theory behind the controller design using feed-forward strategy is explained in details on our instructor, [Angela P. Schoellig](http://www.dynsyslab.org/prof-angela-schoellig/), on her paper [Feed-Forward Parameter Identification for Precise Periodic\n",

    "This is the more complicated part of the project. If the parameter tuning on the python part was hard, this part is ten times harder. The C++ part is just a detail on this onerous task. In this case, the simulator is enforced more real limits to the implementation, and things can go wrong when some of those limits are not implemented correctly. More interesting than that is when things are not entirely wrong, just a bit. Udacity also provides a [seed project](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Controls-CPP) with the simulator implementation and placeholders for the controller code. The seed project README.md give guides to run the project and information of the task we need to execute for implementing the controller. There are five scenarios we need to cover. The simulator runs in a loop on the current scenario and show on the standard output an indication the scenario pass or not.\n",

    "- [/src/QuadControl.cpp](./src/QuadControl.cpp): This is where all the fun is, but I should not say this because this file contains the implementation of the controller only. Most of the time needed to pass the scenarios is spend on the parameter tuning.\n",

These equations come from the classroom lectures. There are a couple of things to consider. For example, on NED coordinates the `z` axis is inverted that is why the moment on `z` was inverted here. Another observation while implementing this is that `F_3` and `F_4` are switched, e.g. `F_3` in the lectures is `F_4` on the simulator and the same for `F_4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the `kpPQR` parameter has to be tuned to stop the drone from flipping, but first, some thrust needs to be commanded in the altitude control because we don't have thrust commanded on the `GenerateMotorCommands` anymore. A good value is `thurst = mass * CONST_GRAVITY`.\n"
